Hello,
Here is a small executable to have access to spicetify! (automation installation and download)

first run a powershell as admin and enter the command:
"set-executionpolicy RemoteSigned"

once run you can close the poweshell and launch the shortcut "Spicetify AutoSetup" remember to have spotify open and connected to your account otherwise it does not work
if you want it to launch when you start your computer put the shortcut in the shell:startup folder
